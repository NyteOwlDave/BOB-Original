# Box

The box tool creates a cubic shape. It allows for programming
various combinations of width, height and depth.

# Usage

For command line usage, type `box` with no parameters.

Usage is also shown in the event of misuse.

```
box <w> <h> <d>
```

Note that height and depth appear swapped, because bob has as
odd arrangement for the Y and Z axes.
